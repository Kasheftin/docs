At first, all there was, was Vuency. But shortly after creating the library, I realized that 95% of it was just Javascript. So I extracted those parts out and created a Ency, a framework independent concurrency library. Now Vuency serves as a wrapper around Ency, that fills in the remaining 5%, to facilitate the Vue specific tasks.

So, if you're just getting started, see the [Ency documentation](/ency) first, for basic usage. Then, you can continue to the [Vuency documentation](/vuency/usage), for extended usage.
